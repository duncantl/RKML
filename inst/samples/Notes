The page
  http://code.google.com/apis/earth/documentation/placemarks.html

tells us how to change the size of a placemark.  So we can use this
when we click on a point in a scatterplot to make the corresponding
placemark bigger.  We need to be able to map from the point to the
placemark object in JavaScript.  We can do this with ids or indices.
