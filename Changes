Version 0.7-1

   *   Add folderNames() function and methods.

   *   Added template HTML and JavaScript code for creating a Web page with Google Earth plugin instance
       embedded.

   *   Functions to access these plugin templates and insert API key and target KML file.

   *   Handle the case in kmlPoints() where we do not specify data and specify .longitude and .latitude.

Version 0.7-0

   *   Clarified the description and docDescription in kml() and some of the related functions
       so that the previous description is now docDescription.

   *   Fixed the creation of the KMZ archive and adjusting the references to local files and saving them.

   *   Added functions to create icons for use as placemarks, etc.

   *   Use CDATA for description nodes.

Version 0.6-1

   *  Fixed some examples to not use /tmp/ directory.

Version 0.6-0

   *  Support for time spans in formula. TimeSpec and TimeSpanSpec classes ('Spec' for specification).

   *  Allow for specifying ids or labels for observations.

   *  Allow for namespace on root node of KML document in createKMLDoc().

Version 0.5-0

   *  kmlTime() creates a new level for missing values in the groups argument.

   *  Default value for addLines in kmlTime() is now FALSE.

   *  Added a simpler, faster, leaner version of newXMLNode() for this package
      to speed up creating XML documents.

   *  Added a much faster implementation of kmlTime() and specifically addFolderPlacemarks()
      that constructs the XML content using a string and then parses that into nodes and adds
      these.

   *  Similar approach and massive speedup for kmlPoints() for large number of <Placemarks>.

Version 0.4-2
 
   *  kmlTime() doesn't add extraneous <Placemark> elements if addLines = FALSE

   *  kmlTime() doesn't add a <StyleUrl> element if the style is NA.

Version 0.4-1

   *  If makeKMZArchive() (typically called via saveXML()) cannot find all the local files
      it creates a KML file with the expectation that the file will be created subsequently. 

   *  makeKMZArchive() now clones the document if appropriate (using xmlClone())

   *  more warning messages from makeKMZArchive(), e.g. if any of the local files 
      mentioned in the KML document don't exist.

   *  handle difference between <Icon>file name</Icon> and 
      <Icon><href>filename</href></Icon> better.

Version 0.4-0

   *  Added kmlLegend() function to allow inclusion of an existing image or creating an 
      R-style legend to place on Google Earth.

   *  Added kmlPolygon(), kmlText(), for drawing graphical elements onto the KML display.

   *  kmlLegend() for displaying a legend on the KML display.

   *  groundOverlay() for adding an image as a ground overlay

   *  Map local file names when creating KMZ files to sub-directories with the 
      ZIP archive.

   *  saveXML() method for creating regular KML files for AsIs file names (rather than KMZ files if
      the KMLDoc contains local files)

   *  Prototype/initial implementation of a KML device for rendering R graphics on a KML display
      as objects, not just via an image as a ground overlay. See inst/KMLDevice/kmlDevice.R.


Version 0.3-0
 
   *  We use the latest version of the Rcompression package to create KMZ (zip)
      files directly in R rather than via an external zip program.

Version 0.2-0

   * additional facilities for kmlTime() and kmlPoints() for specifying
     the names and descriptions  for the points and also not connecting
     each point in time.

   * extensions to the formula parsing to recognize time and also evaluate
     expressions (e.g. - longitude  or long + sqrt(lat) @ I( 2 * times)

   * Added kmlCircle() and kmlSegments().
