<h1>RKML</h1>

<p>
 This is an initial implementation of a package that provides R
users with  high-level facilities to generate <a href="">KML</a>, the Keyhole
 Markup Language for display in, e.g., Google Earth.
By high-level, we mean that the R user does not have to (but can)
create the XML directly herself. Instead, there are high-level
functions which take care of  these lower-level details.
</p>

<p> The package is intended to provide the basics and illustrate how
others can build on this framework to add more functionality and allow
other users to leverage more of the KML facilities.  As such, the
package is far from a complete interface to KML, but more a
proof-of-concept and an encouragement for statisticians to explore
this rich form of visualization. We will add to the package as time
permits and we need to for our own use.  We strongly encourage others
to build on this, contribute code back or take over the package if
they are intending to do much work in this area. Please chat with us
via email to let us know about your plans so we can help and
coordinate with others.  </p>

<p>
The main elements the package provides are
the high-level <code>kml()</code> function,
and the slightly lower-level/more-specific
functions <code>kmlPoints()</code> and <code>kmlTime()</code>.
<code>kmlPoints()</code> displays points on the earth.
<code>kmlTime()</code> displays points but connects them with
lines and puts a time stamp on each.
</p>
<p>
These functions need to know the variables that correspond
to longitude, latitude and time.  One can change the names of
the variables in the data set, or more conveniently and richly use
a formula notation. The formula is something like
<pre>
  ~ X + Y @ timeVariable
</pre>
This is not comprehensively implemented yet in terms of allowing
transformations of the variables within the formula, but
we will do this in the future. This notation will also support
an expression on the right hand side and conditioning and
this can be used for various interesting effects.
</p>
<p>
There are more nuts-and-bolt functions for creating specific KML elements.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="JSM2011">Four new annotated examples presented at the JSM 2011</a>
  <dd>  A collection of examples based around Global and Regional Circulation
        (Climate) Model data.
       These illustrate polygons as placemarks, animation over time
  with images and  polygons, synchronized animation in a pair of
  embedded Google Earth plugins in a Web page, and a slider changing
  the color of polygons in GE.
  
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="Examples/elephantSeal.kml">Elephant Seal travels</a>
  <dd> Deb Nolan's visualization of the travels of an elephant seal.
       Data from David Brillinger and Brent Steward

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="Examples/harpSeal.kml">Norwegian Harp Seal</a>
  <dd> Data from the <a  href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/argosfilter">argosfilter</a>
       package.
      

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="Examples/seaos.kml">Seaos seal paths</a>
      
  <dd> Yet more seals! This is from the <a href="http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/seaos/results_oceano.htm">Seaos</a> project
       at St. Andrews. This uses the seals to sample the ocean
       characteristic. 
      
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="Examples/CityTemperatures.kmz">Average temperatures in 100 US cities</a> in January, April, July
      and October.      
  <dd> This illustrates drawing time series created by R on Google
       Earth at specific locations and also allowing the user to control
       time.
        The colors show the temperature, the flatness or peakedness
       illustrate the variability. Clicking on a city also shows
        the data for the city as a table and a larger version of the
  plot.
       <p>
       There are many ways this could be improved. Try some!
       <p>
       See <a  href="http://www.omegahat.org/GoogleEarth/CityTemperatures/">here
  for more details</a>
       </p>

  <dt>
  <li> <a href="Examples/cities.kml">US Cities</a>
  <dd> A view of ~ 1200 US cities merely displayed at their locations
       on Google Earth with a minimal description provided giving the city
       name and state.
</dl>
</ul>

The code to generate these are in the package in the tests/ directory.
This is the best place to look for working examples of different
features. The examples in the Rd files may not be as comprehensive
until I move the code from the tests to the Rd files.
